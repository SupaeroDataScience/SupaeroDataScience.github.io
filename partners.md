# Information for partners

A reason for the Data Science program's success is the richness of its community and partners: outstanding teachers, passionnate engineers, great supporting companies.

The program is an initiative that is open to the world: societal impacts, industry and private sector stakes, new scientific or technical challenges, we believe it is by the contribution of every actor that we will build a better place for our students and for the future.

There are a few "classic" ways partners can interact with us:
- [Internships]({{ site.url }}/internships.html)
We take great care that our students embark on challenging, high added value internships. You have one of those? [Write to us]({{ site.url }}/contact.html).
- The [hackathon]({{ site.url }}/hackathon.html)
3 intense days with our students. The final project in the program on a challenging data science task.
- [Contrats pro]({{ site.url }}/contratspro.html)
Part-time contract between September and March, then full-time until August.
- Dedicated events
[Write to us]({{ site.url }}/contact.html).
- Seminars
We have a running seminar all year long. We welcome people that come to share their passion, motivation and experience (be it technical, scientific, social...). However we strictly enforce one rule: no advertising for companies, we're interested in people and sharing, this is not the place for recruitment (see Dedicated events for that).

## History of European Data Protection

+ **1970s**, Europe: reaction to the rise of computers. existing law (including privacy law) would not be able to effectively protect individual rights from the risks brought about by the use of automated data processing systems.
+ **1980**, OECD Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data
+ **January 28, 1981**, the Council opened for signature the ‘Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automated Processing of Personal Data’
  + control how computers are allowed to “think” about humans (what they can learn about us, what they must forget about us and when, for what purposes they can use what they know about us, what decisions they can make about us, and how they are supposed to explain all of that to us)
  + granted specific rights to individuals that could be exceeded against any entity that had control over the processing of personal data related to the individual.
+ **1995**, European Data Protection Directive, in effect until GDPR in 2018
+ **2012**, Workplan 29 Opinion on data protection reform proposal, leading to current GDPR

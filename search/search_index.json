There is also a large section on python, with an emphasis on data science scripting practices using numpy and pandas in jupyter notebooks. This is a self-guided exercise with resources and questions on this site. You, the participant, must look for the answer to the questions through reading documentation, discussing with others, and trying things. Try to avoid searching for answers online in a search engine; the answers can almost always be found in documentation. Answers can be submitted through an API with the CTF server. Resources to answer different sections will be made available throughout the week; for example, some python questions require data which won't be available until the halfway point. Responding correctly to a question gives 1 point, and an additional 0.5 points are awarded for being the first to submit the correct answer to a question. That half point is the flag - be the first to capture it! However, if you're speeding through the questions, consider helping others learn the material. Depending on your background, you may have varied experience with these tools. Get to know the other participants by helping them capture a flag too. The CTF server's IP address is 13.39.51.160 . You can see a leaderboard there and it is the address for submitting answers. The first way we'll look at submitting answers is with curl in Linux. Linux \ud83d\udd17 Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix. It is a standard choice for development and is the most dominant operating system for web servers, cloud computing, and high performance computing at 80% of global public servers. There are many different distributions but they share a common set of tools, notably GNU software. A very common Linux distribution is Android, at 73% of all mobile devices , so you might be a Linux user already without realizing it! You most likely don't use Linux as the operating system of your personal computer, however. If you are using one the 2.5 % of personal computers with Linux, you can skip straight to the Submission section MacOS is also based on Unix, so if you're using MacOS, most things should work just as in Linux! A few commands will be different from the course instructions, and the questions will always refer to Linux resources, for example documentation. It is highly recommended to install homebrew (https://brew.sh/) which will allow for package installation via the command line. Installation on Windows \ud83d\udd17 The easiest way to use Linux on Windows is through the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Installation instructions are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install . Make sure to follow all instructions carefully. If asked to join a \"Windows Insiders Program\", ignore this. By default, this installs Ubuntu, which is good for this systems class and for all of SDD. The WSL is similar to a virtual machine inside of Windows, but it integrates with some existing components of Windows. You can access your Windows files from Linux at /mnt/ , but you should make sure you're familiar with Linux first. About the WSL WSL FAQ How to Access WSL Linux Files from Windows Submission \ud83d\udd17 Once you have a Unix-type environment, either native Linux or macOS, or through the WSL, you're ready to submit to the CTF. You will use the curl command; you can verify that you have curl by running which curl in the command line. curl is a tool for transferring data from or to a server. How do you know that? By checking the documentation of curl using man curl . Try it out! To respond to a question, send a POST request with the data of the question number and answer , and your username as user (your username should be your ISAE login, but you can also check on the leaderboard). For example, the first question asks where the curl executable is (hint: use which ). Then use curl : curl -X POST 'http://13.39.51.160/' \\ -d 'number=1' \\ -d 'answer=your answer here' \\ -d 'user=your username here' Some of the questions will require access to some files, called file_a.txt , file_b.txt , and file_c.txt . Here are three different ways to download using curl and wget : curl http://13.39.51.160/files/file_a.txt -o file_a.txt curl http://13.39.51.160/files/file_b.txt > file_b.txt wget http://13.39.51.160/files/file_c.txt Be sure to download all three files, using whichever method. You are ready to start answering questions! If you don't know an answer, check the resources below and read documentation using man . You can see which questions you have answered by sending a GET request: curl 'http://13.39.51.160/user/d.wilson' You can also see which questions have remaining flags, the bonus points associated with answering the question for the first time, with a GET request: curl 'http://13.39.51.160/answers/' Questions \ud83d\udd17 1 | Where is the curl executable located?

It has seen wide adoption with servers like Github and Gitlab while being an open-source tool that anyone can install as a client or server. In this class, we will look at repositories hosted on Github, but git is much larger than that and many organizations like ISAE have their own private git server . Installation \ud83d\udd17 If you're using Ubuntu, chances are you already have git . If not, simply do: sudo apt install git These questions concern two repositories: the Machine Learning class in SDD ( https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/machine-learning ) and the Seaborn library, a popular graphing library ( https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn ). You will need to download both repositories. First choose a directory to host them in, for example ~/cours/SD/FSD319 : mkdir -p cours/SD/FSD319 cd cours/SD/FSD319 and then download them using git clone: git clone https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/machine-learning.git git clone https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn.git The commit for the seaborn repository is 1e6739 : git checkout 1e6739 Questions \ud83d\udd17 31 | How many directories are there in the root directory of the machine-learning repository? 32 | How many total files are there in the machine-learning repository and all subdirectories?

The SSH section has references explaining public-key cryptography , but in general you will make a key pair with a private side and public side. You will give the public side to services like this class or Github to perform secure communication, keeping your private key secret to prove that it is you.

You may need to install some of these, either using apt , brew , yum , pacman , or whichever package manager you use. Linux comes with many programs installed by default, especially distributions like Ubuntu, however the tools in this section will be more useful than the base Linux tools. We'll cover four: apt for package management, top for system monitoring, tmux for terminal management, and vim for file editing. There are alternatives to all of these programs that are great, but it is worth being familiar with these four.

Installation \ud83d\udd17 You most likely have python installed on your Linux system, but it is worthwhile to make sure and to upgrade. Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 are all supported. sudo apt install python3 It is highly recommended to make a virtual environment to manage your python packages. There are three main libraries for virtual environments: Virtualenv Pipenv Conda Virtualenv is recommended for new users on Linux. Conda, or the platform Anaconda, can be useful on Windows as many packages are built specifically for windows, but not all packages are available via conda. Pipenv is an exciting project aimed at Python developers, but it adds additional complexity. Once you have a virtual environment created, please install the following packages for the rest of the Seminars class: numpy pandas scipy matplotlib jupyter The following packages will also be used in SDD and some in SD: seaborn scikit-learn keras torch geos graphviz nltk networkx statsmodels pyspark cython cma gym Jupyter \ud83d\udd17 Jupyter (stands for the three original languages in the project: Julia, Python, and R) is a way to use and develop code interactively in the browser. Once you've installed the jupyter package, you can run a Jupyter notebook by simply running jupyter notebook . For Windows users, you can run Jupyter in the WSL. As explained in this blog post , you simply need to execute jupyter notebook --no-browser on the WSL and then copy and paste the URL and token generated into a Windows browser. Some additional packages for improving Jupyter are nbopen nbdime RISE . Be sure to read their documentation before installing to verify if these are relevant to you.

You, the participant, must look for the answer to the questions through reading documentation, discussing with others, and trying things. Try to avoid searching for answers online in a search engine; the answers can almost always be found in documentation. Answers can be submitted through an API with the CTF server. Resources to answer different sections will be made available throughout the week; for example, some python questions require data which won't be available until the halfway point. Responding correctly to a question gives 1 point, and an additional 0.5 points are awarded for being the first to submit the correct answer to a question. That half point is the flag - be the first to capture it! However, if you're speeding through the questions, consider helping others learn the material. Depending on your background, you may have varied experience with these tools. Get to know the other participants by helping them capture a flag too. The CTF server's IP address is 13.39.51.160 .

Once you have a virtual environment created, please install the following packages for the rest of the Seminars class: numpy pandas scipy matplotlib jupyter The following packages will also be used in SDD and some in SD: seaborn scikit-learn keras torch geos graphviz nltk networkx statsmodels pyspark cython cma gym","title":"Installation"},{"location":"systems.html#jupyter","text":"Jupyter (stands for the three original languages in the project: Julia, Python, and R) is a way to use and develop code interactively in the browser. Once you've installed the jupyter package, you can run a Jupyter notebook by simply running jupyter notebook . For Windows users, you can run Jupyter in the WSL. As explained in this blog post , you simply need to execute jupyter notebook --no-browser on the WSL and then copy and paste the URL and token generated into a Windows browser. Some additional packages for improving Jupyter are nbopen nbdime RISE . Be sure to read their documentation before installing to verify if these are relevant to you.","title":"Jupyter"},{"location":"systems.html#questions_4","text":"91 | What is the name of the standard python library module for creating virtual environments? 92 | What is the name of the command used for activating an environment when using virtualenv? 93 | What is the name of the pip command used to display all currently installed packages, in a format that can be used to install them using pip ? 94 | What is the URL of the Python Package Index? 95 | What is the jupyter command to convert a notebook to a different file type? 96 | In what year did Python first appear? 97 | What is the latest major stable version of Python? 98 | What was the end-of-life date for Python 3.6?

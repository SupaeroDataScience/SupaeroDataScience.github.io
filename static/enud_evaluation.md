# Privacy and Data Protection

**ISAE-SUPAERO, SDD, January 2020**

## FSD313 Evaluation 1 : Moot court (procès fictif)

For the evaluation of this class, you will re-enact landmark cases in data
protection. You will be organizes in 3 teams for each trial; a team of 4 for
each claimant and a team of 6 judges.

Schedule:
+ 15 minutes oral argument of first party
+ 15 minutes oral argument of second party
+ 30 minutes questioning from the judges, 15 minute response time per party
+ 5 minutes closing statement from the first party
+ 5 minutes closing statement from the second party

<!--s-->

## Oral Arguments

Present the following:
+ Who are you representing?
+ What is the main point you are defending?
+ What is the legal evidence to confirm your point?
+ If there are existing related rulings, how do they support your claim?
+ What is the opposing party's claim?
+ Why is your claim correct over the opposing party's claim?

<!--s-->

## Questioning

Judges take turns asking questions; claimants have 15 minutes total time to
respond to questions for each party. It is the judge's responsability to prepare
good questions, keep track of time, and regulate discussion by asking for
rebuttals when appropriate.

Good questions should:
+ Clarify points from the oral arguments
+ Expand on opposing points from the two claimants
+ Expose fundamental concepts and definitions being decided

Judges should not seek to penalize the other teams for not knowing details about
the case, related cases, or data protection law, but should build on the
preparation done by each team to foster a useful discussion for their decision.

Claimants should have prepared materials easily accessible so that they can
better respond to questions.

<!--s-->

## Closing statements

5 minute statements by each claimant which summarizes the main arguments made
for their claim, taking into account the opposing claim's oral arguments and
questioning. You should prepare a draft in advance and modify it during the
trial.

<!--s-->

## Decision

<div class="textbox">

1 week after the trial, the judges must turn in a written decision (1-2 pages)
explaining the arguments from both claimants, the decision they reached, and why
they made their decision. This should include the overall decision of the case,
any penalties levied for either party, and any further definitions or
implications of this decision (ie, a more precise definition of "controller" for
the GDPR). The decision must be based on the oral arguments and questioning done
in class, but should include a comparison to the decision made in the real case.

Recommendation: split judges into two groups of 3, one for preparation, one for
writing the decision.

## History of Data Protection

1970s as a reaction to the rise of computers. The consensus in Europe at the time was that existing law (including privacy law) would not be able to effectively protect individual rights from the risks brought about by the use of automated data processing systems.
+ January 28 of 1981, the Council opened for signature the ‘Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automated Processing of Personal Data’
+ control how computers are allowed to “think” about humans (what they can learn about us, what they must forget about us and when, for what purposes they can use what they know about us, what decisions they can make about us, and how they are supposed to explain all of that to us)
+ granted specific rights to individuals that could be exceeded against any entity that had control over the processing of personal data related to the individual.
+ Data Protection Directive 1995

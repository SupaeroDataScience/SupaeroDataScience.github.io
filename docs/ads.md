## Data Regulation

An overview of the history of data privacy regulation and an in-depth analysis of the GDPR.

The evaluation for this module takes the form of a mock trial, where students will simulate real cases in data privacy. The class on the GDPR will help students prepare for case analysis and presentation.

## Data Security

An introductory class to the foundational principles and modern practices of data security in the context of data science, covering cryptography, secure data storage, and transmission methods. Students explore encryption techniques, both symmetric and asymmetric, along with key management strategies to protect sensitive information.

## Hackathon

Since the creation of the program in 2015, one of our key classes in SDD has
been the end-of-year Hackathon. Industrial and academic partners present
real-world, challenging Data Science problems for the SDD students. Students
work in teams and rush to an innovative solution in a 72 hours intensive sprint. [More details here](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/hackathon.html).

## Business Intelligence

Lionel Rigaud, President of [Trimane](https://www.trimane.fr/), presents 10
hours of class and simulation on business intelligence and the digital economy.

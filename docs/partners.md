# Information for partners

A reason for the Data Science program's success is the richness of its community and partners: outstanding teachers, passionnate engineers, great supporting companies.

The program is an initiative that is open to the world: societal impacts, industry and private sector stakes, new scientific or technical challenges, we believe it is by the contribution of every actor that we will build a better place for our students and for the future.

There are a few "classic" ways partners can interact with us:

- Internships<br>
We take great care that our students embark on challenging, high added value internships. You have one of those? [Write to us](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/contact.html).
- The [hackathon](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/hackathon.html)<br>
3 intense days with our students. The final project in the program on a challenging data science task.
- Professional contracts:
Part-time contract between September and March, then full-time until August.
- Dedicated events<br>
We are open to suggestions about dedicated events such as competitions, hackathons, or attending recruitment events. [Write to us](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/contact.html) with suggestions.
- [Seminars](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/fsd319.html)<br>
We have a running seminar all year long. We welcome people that come to share their passion, motivation and experience (be it technical, scientific, social...). However we strictly enforce one rule: no advertising for companies, we're interested in people and sharing, this is not the place for recruitment.

# SDD Hackathon

Since the creation of the program in 2015, one of our key classes in SDD has
been the end-of-year Hackathon. Industrial and academic partners present
real-world, challengening Data Science problems for the SDD students. Students
work in teams and rush to an innovative solution in a 72 hours intensive sprint. 

**The 2023-2024 hackathon will be held February 26 - 28, 2024.**
Interested partners for the SDD hackathon should [contact us](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/contact.html).

The Hackathon's topics are issued from partners: either research labs (public or
private) or engineering teams in companies. All data and topics can be covered
by confidentiality agreements (although we clearly prefer shareable data).

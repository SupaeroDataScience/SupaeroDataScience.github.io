# FSD319 - Seminars

We host seminars on a variety of topics in data science, artificial intelligence, and big data. These seminars are open to the campus but are organized as a part of SDD. External partners are encouraged to [contact us](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/contact.html) to coordinate seminars.

## Competitions

Throughout the year, students can participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/) or other competitions, using time slots of FSD319 to work on these competitions.

## Caf√© SDD

SDD coffees are times to meet informally with industry and academic experts in AI to discuss questions such as:

  + What is daily life like as a data scientists?
  + What motivates data scientists in their work?
  + What are the big problems to work on in AI?
  + How do we reconcile personal values and various aspects of data science such as personal data use?
  + What steps brought the expert to their current position?
  + What advice do they have for new data scientists?

These coffees are organized primarily by the students, through coordination of the delegates and the SDD organizers.

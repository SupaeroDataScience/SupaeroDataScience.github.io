This page features some projects made with students that deserved to be in the spotlight.

## ML notebooks

Every year, as part of the "[Algorithms in Machine Learning]({{ site.url }}/syllabus.html#fsd311)"'s evaluation, students have to assemble a notebook on a specific Machine Learning topic. This notebook needs to be didactic, rigorous and useful for the reader. It sould be readable in around 1.5 hours. All notebooks are then peer-reviewed by other students and by academic staff. Some really deserve some publicity, so we link to them here.

- TBD.

## RL challenge

The RL challenge is a friendly competition between students in the [RL class]({{ site.url }}/syllabus.html#fsd311). Here are a few videos from past editions.

TBD.

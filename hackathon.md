# SDD Hackathon

## The 2021 hackathon will be held the 1-3rd of March

Since the creation of the program in 2015, one of our key classes in SDD has
been the end-of-year Hackathon. Industrial and academic partners present
real-world, challengening Data Science problems for the SDD students. Students
work in teams and rush to an innovative solution in a 72 hours intensive sprint. 

The Hackathon's topics are all issued from partners: either research labs
(public or private) or engineering teams in companies. All data and topics can
be covered by confidentiality agreements (although we clearly prefer shareable
data). Occasionally, we welcome a external students for the Hackathon.

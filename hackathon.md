# Hackathon

## The 2020 hackathon will be held the 25-27th of March

Since the creation of the program in 2015, one of our key classes in SDD has been the internal Hackathon.

At the end of training (all classes are over, the students start their internships a few weeks later), one or several real-world, open-ended Data Science problem is revealed. Students work in teams and rush to an innovative solution in a 72 hours intensive sprint. 

The Hackathon's topics are all issued from partners: either research labs (public or private) or engineering teams in companies. All data and topics can be covered by confidentiality agreements (although we clearly prefer shareable data). Occasionally, we welcome a few external students for the Hackathon.

This year for the first time we will also be holding a 1 day hackathon on January 22nd.
